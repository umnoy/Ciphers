## Ciphers
This is an open-source code that includes the implementation of 6 ciphers and their cryptanalysis.  
This code provides:
* Simple substitution cipher
* Affine and Recurrent Affine ciphers
* Hill and Recurrent ciphers
* Vigen√®re cipher
* Frequency analysis
* Brute force for Affine and Recurrent Affine ciphers
* Key calculation for Hill and Recurrent Affine ciphers

#### Usage
To start this program, you need to run *"main.py"* and then follow the instructions.

#### Attention
I am not a professional programmer, so this is definitely not a perfect implementation of these ciphers. However, if you know how to improve this code, you can always contact me at:

Enjoy!
